Margins prediction using MultioutputRegressor in Fabric Notebook-(Python ML)

Built a supervised machine learning model (v0.1) using Python’s librariesPandas and Sklearn in the Microsoft Fabric Notebook.
● Predicted Current Year (CY) VoNB and Expense Margins based on Last Year
(LY) performance metrics.
● Utilized features like Annualized Premium (AP), policy term, payment term,
customer age, and distribution channel.
● Leveraged ChatGPT, Deepseek and Grok AI for predictive models/algorithm
assistance and code optimization

**Result**- successfully reduced margins prediction time by 60% by eliminating the
complex formula based traditional excel model.
